-- stepsPower n k gives the number of steps that

    Tests:
    Mathematical tests to make sure the function outputs expected 
    values for supported inputs:

    This is to make sure that 0 to the power of an integer is 0.
    1. 0 to the power of 2 should be 0. 

    This is to make sure that an integer to the power of 0 is 1.
    2. 2 raised to the power of 0 should be 1.

    This is to make sure that 1 to the power of an integer is 1.
    3. 1 to the power of 50 should be 1.

    This is to test that the function supports very large numbers
    4. 2 to the power of 100 should be 1267650600228229401496703205376.

    These are to make sure that the function works for negative bases
    5. -2 to the power of 3 should be -8.
    6. -2 to the power of 4 should be 16.

    Program tests for making sure the functions handle unsupported types 
    7. Negative exponents should cause an error - Since its not supported
    8. Functions should only take integers - to prevent type errors
